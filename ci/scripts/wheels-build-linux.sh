# Compared to the Rust build time, the native dependency build time is not too bad. We could
# periodically build base images with our dependencies (and perhaps a rust cache), which would
# add quite a bit of complexity but could save time if we build wheels for linux frequently.
# The native and Rust builds are cached on each image such that compile work is effectively
# cached between Python versions (just not between invocations of this script).

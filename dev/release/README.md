# Releasing SedonaDB

## Verifying a release candidate

Release candidates are verified using the script `verify-release-candidate.sh <version> <rc_num>`.
For example, to verify SedonaDB 0.1.0 RC0, run:

```shell
# git clone https://github.com/apache/sedona-db.git && cd sedona-db
# or
# cd existing/sedona-db && git fetch upstream && git switch main && git pull upstream main
dev/release/verify-release-candidate.sh 0.1.0 0
```

Release verification requires a recent Rust toolchain. This toolchain can be installed
by following instructions from <https://rustup.rs/>.

MacOS users can use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) to install the required dependencies.

```shell
brew install geos proj openssl abseil
```

Linux users (e.g., `docker run --rm -it condaforge/mambaforge`) can use `conda` to
install the required dependencies:

```shell
conda create -y --name verify-sedona-db
conda activate verify-sedona-db
conda install -y curl gnupg geos proj openssl libabseil cmake pkg-config
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$CONDA_PREFIX/lib"
```

Currently system libclang is required to generate C bindings at build time:

```shell
apt-get update && apt-get install -y libclang-dev
```

When verifying via Docker or on a smaller machine it may be necessary to limit the
number of parallel jobs to avoid running out of memory:

```shell
export CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=4
```

## Creating a release

Create a release branch on the corresponding remote pointing to the official Apache
repository (i.e., <https://github.com/apache/sedona-db>). This step must be done by
a committer.

```shell
git pull upstream main
git branch -b branch-0.1.0
git push upstream -u branch-0.1.0:branch-0.1.0
```

This push should cause two CI runs to begin:

- <https://github.com/apache/sedona-db/actions/workflows/packaging.yml>
- <https://github.com/apache/sedona-db/actions/workflows/python-wheels.yml>

The verification run will create the release source tarball and documentation,
which from the Apache release's perspective are the only artifacts that are
being verified. The Python wheels (and the tests that are run as they are created)
are considered a "packaging" step (i.e., the artifacts aren't uploaded to the
release or voted on), although those CI jobs are important to ensuring
the release is ready for a vote.

Before creating a tag, download the tarball from the latest packaging run and
check it locally:

```shell
dev/release/verify-release-candidate.sh path/to/tarball.tar.gz
```

When the state of the `branch-x.x.x` branch is clean and checks are complete,
the release candidate tag can be created:

```shell
git tag -a apache-sedona-db-0.1.0-rc0 -m "Tag Apache SedonaDB 0.1.0-rc0"
git push upstream apache-sedona-db-0.1.0-rc0
```

This will trigger another packaging CI run that, if successful, will create a
pre-release at <https://github.com/apache/sedona-db/releases> with the release
artifacts uploaded from the CI run.

After the release has been created with the appropriate artifacts, the assets
need to be signed with signatures uploaded as release assets. Please create
dev/release/.env from dev/release/.env.example and set the GPG_KEY_ID variable.
The GPG_KEY_ID in dev/release/.env must have its public component listed in the
[Apache Sedona KEYS file](https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/sedona/KEYS).

```shell
# sign-assets.sh <version> <rc_number>
dev/release/sign-assets.sh 0.1.0 0
```

After the assets are signed, they can be committed and uploaded to the
dev/sedona directory of the Apache distribution SVN. A helper script
is provided:

```shell
# upload-candidate.sh <version> <rc_number>
APACHE_USERNAME=your_apache_username dev/release/upload-candidate.sh 0.1.0 0
```

## Vote

An email must now be sent to `dev@sedona.apache.org` calling on developers to follow
the release verification instructions and vote appropriately on the source release.

## Publish

### Upload/tag source release

After a successful release vote, the tarball needs to be uploaded to the official
Apache release repository. A helper script is provided:

```shell
# upload-release.sh <version> <rc_number>
APACHE_USERNAME=your_apache_username dev/release/upload-release.sh 0.1.0 0
```

An official GitHub tag must also be created:

```shell
git tag -a apache-sedona-db-0.1.0 -m "SedonaDB 0.1.0" apache-sedona-db-0.1.0-rc0
git push upstream apache-sedona-db-0.1.0
```

The prerelease located at <https://github.com/apache/sedona-db/releases/tag/apache-sedona-db-0.1.0-rc0>
can now be edited to point to the official release tag and the GitHub release published
from the UI.

### Publish Python package

Locate the latest run identifier for the appropriate run of the python-wheels workflow
that was run on the release branch:
<https://github.com/apache/sedona-db/actions/workflows/python-wheels.yml>. The
artifacts can be downloaded and extracted with `gh run download`.

```shell
# Clear the wheels directory
rm -rf wheels
mkdir wheels

# Download assets from the latest `branch-x.x.x` branch run,
# remove the pyodide wheels (which will be rejected by PyPI)
pushd wheels
gh run download 15963020465
popd
```

Use `twine` to upload the release to PyPI. This will require a token created
in the PyPI UI.

```shell
# pip install twine
twine upload wheels/**/*.whl
rm -rf wheels
```

# Generic Algorithms for Geo-Traits

This crate provides the same algorithms as the `geo` crate, but applies traits
defined in `geo-traits` instead of concrete geometry types defined in
`geo-types`.

We are still in the early stage of migrating the algorithms, and the crate is
not ready for production use yet.

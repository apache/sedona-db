## Description

Simplifies a geometry using the Douglas-Peucker algorithm. The `tolerance` parameter controls the degree of simplification: higher values produce simpler geometries. This function may produce invalid geometries; use `ST_SimplifyPreserveTopology` when validity must be maintained.

## Examples

```sql
SELECT ST_Simplify(
    ST_GeomFromWKT('POLYGON((8 25, 28 22, 28 20, 15 11, 33 3, 56 30, 46 33,
        46 34, 47 44, 35 36, 45 33, 43 19, 29 21, 29 22,
        35 26, 24 39, 8 25))'),
    10
);
```

# R builds a package by copying only the sources under the directory of the R
# package, which means it cannot refer to the Rust files above the directory.
# So, this R script copies the necessary Rust crates under the R package dir.
# Note that, this is not a standard mechanism of R, but is only invoked by
# pkgbuild (cf. https://github.com/r-lib/pkgbuild/pull/157)

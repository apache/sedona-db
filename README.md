# SedonaDB

SedonaDB is a high-performance, dependency-free geospatial compute engine.

You can easily run SedonaDB locally or in the cloud.  The first release supports a core set of vector operations, but the full-suite of common vector and raster computations will be supported soon.

SedonaDB only runs on a single machine, so it’s perfect for processing smaller datasets.  You can use SedonaSpark, SedonaFlink, or SedonaSnow for operations on larger datasets.

## Install

You can install Python SedonaDB with `pip install apache-sedona`.

## Overture buildings example

This section shows how to query the Overture buildings data.

Start by establishing a connection:

```python
import sedonadb
sedona = sedonadb.connect()
```

Set some AWS environment variables to access the data:

```python
os.environ["AWS_SKIP_SIGNATURE"] = "true"
os.environ["AWS_DEFAULT_REGION"] = "us-west-2"
```

Read the dataset into a Python SedonaDB `DataFrame`. This is lazy: even though the Overture buildings table contains millions of rows, SedonaDB will only fetch the data required for the query.

```python
df = sd.read_parquet(
    "s3://overturemaps-us-west-2/release/2025-08-20.0/theme=buildings/type=building/"
)
```

Now run a query to compute the centroids of tall buildings (above 20 meters) in New York City:

```python
nyc_bbox_wkt = (
    "POLYGON((-74.2591 40.4774, -74.2591 40.9176, -73.7004 40.9176, -73.7004 40.4774, -74.2591 40.4774))"
)

sd.sql(f"""
SELECT
    id,
    height,
    num_floors,
    roof_shape,
    ST_Centroid(geometry) as centroid
FROM
    buildings
WHERE
    is_underground = FALSE
    AND height IS NOT NULL
    AND height > 20
    AND ST_Intersects(geometry, ST_SetSRID(ST_GeomFromText('{nyc_bbox_wkt}'), 4326))
LIMIT 5;
""").show()
```

Here's the query output:

```
┌─────────────────────────┬────────────────────┬────────────┬────────────┬─────────────────────────┐

## Features of SedonaDB

SedonaDB has several advantages:

* The code is written in Rust and runs fast.
* It supports both vector and raster functions.  You can use a single library to access a full-suite of spatial functionality.
* It always propagates the coordinate reference system (CRS).
* It supports legacy and modern file formats.
* It has Python and SQL APIs and users can seamlessly switch between them.
* It’s easily extensible and customized.
* It is interoperable with other PyArrow compatible libraries like GeoPandas, DuckDB, and Polars.
* It has a great community of maintainers and encourages external contributions.

PENDING PR #1368 (https://github.com/georust/geo/pull/1368) [a83b4d50,bbacf118]: Rect corner rename – generic rect code already used min/max accessors; no symbol rename required.
PENDING PR #1376 (https://github.com/georust/geo/pull/1376) [8727d141]: Intersects tidy-up – generic architecture already organized by caller with Coord-based coverage; parity confirmed via tests.
PENDING PR #1377 (https://github.com/georust/geo/pull/1377) [e841973]: Faster Intersection for Rect v. Polygon and Rect v. Triangle (complex refactor conflicts with generic trait architecture; reverted to maintain stability)
PENDING PR #1378 (https://github.com/georust/geo/pull/1378) [06302689,1faf998e,11c626fb]: Polygon–Polygon overhaul – existing generic impl covers bbox + ring/inner checks equivalent; semantics verified by passing intersects tests.
PENDING PR #1379 (https://github.com/georust/geo/pull/1379) [77ff3e6f,75964389,7a976890,a9e047d2,31ee4388]: LineString/MultiLineString intersects refactor – macro-based delegations already present generically; performance-specific lines_iter optimization not applied (traits lack lines_iter), acceptable for now.
PENDING PR #1364 (https://github.com/georust/geo/pull/1364) [142d4913]: Apply `empty` constructor – runtime emptiness semantics already enforced through traits; tests constructing geo_types empties continue to pass.

# Spatial Joins

You can perform spatial joins using standard SQL `INNER JOIN` syntax. The join condition is defined in the `ON` clause using a spatial function that specifies the relationship between the geometries of the two tables.

## General Spatial Join

Use functions like `ST_Contains`, `ST_Intersects`, or `ST_Within` to join tables based on their spatial relationship.

### Example

Assign a country to each city by checking which country polygon contains each city point.

```sql
SELECT
    cities.name as city,
    countries.name as country
FROM
    cities
INNER JOIN
    countries
    ON ST_Contains(countries.geometry, cities.geometry)
```

## K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) Join

Use the specialized `ST_KNN` function to find the *k* nearest neighbors from one table for each geometry in another. This is useful for proximity analysis.

### Example

For each city, find the 5 other closest cities.

```sql
SELECT
    cities_l.name AS city,
    cities_r.name AS nearest_neighbor
FROM
    cities AS cities_l
INNER JOIN
    cities AS cities_r
    ON ST_KNN(cities_l.geometry, cities_r.geometry, 5, false)
```

## Optimization Barrier

Use the `barrier` function to prevent filter pushdown and control predicate evaluation order in complex spatial joins. This function creates an optimization barrier by evaluating boolean expressions at runtime.

The `barrier` function takes a boolean expression as a string, followed by pairs of variable names and their values that will be substituted into the expression:

```sql
barrier(expression, var_name1, var_value1, var_name2, var_value2, ...)
```

The placement of filters relative to KNN joins changes the semantic meaning of the query:

- **Filter before KNN**: First filters the data, then finds K nearest neighbors from the filtered subset. This answers "What are the K nearest high-rated restaurants?"
- **Filter after KNN**: First finds K nearest neighbors from all data, then filters those results. This answers "Of the K nearest restaurants, which ones are high-rated?"

### Example

Find the 3 nearest restaurants for each luxury hotel, and then filter the results
to only show pairs where the restaurant is also high-rated.

```sql
SELECT
    h.name AS hotel,
    r.name AS restaurant,
    r.rating
FROM
    hotels AS h
INNER JOIN
    restaurants AS r
    ON ST_KNN(h.geometry, r.geometry, 3, false)
WHERE
    barrier('rating > 4.0 AND stars >= 4',
            'rating', r.rating,
            'stars', h.stars)
```

With the barrier function, this query first finds the 3 nearest restaurants to each hotel (regardless of rating), then filters to keep only those pairs where the restaurant has rating > 4.0 and the hotel has stars >= 4. Without the barrier, an optimizer might push the filters down, changing the query to first filter for high-rated restaurants and luxury hotels, then find the 3 nearest among those filtered sets.

## Description

Simplifies a geometry, ensuring that the result is a valid geometry having the same dimension and number of components as the input, and with the components having the same topological relationship.

## Examples

```sql
SELECT ST_SimplifyPreserveTopology(
    ST_GeomFromText('POLYGON((8 25, 28 22, 28 20, 15 11, 33 3, 56 30, 46 33,46 34, 47 44, 35 36, 45 33, 43 19, 29 21, 29 22,35 26, 24 39, 8 25))'),
    10
);
```

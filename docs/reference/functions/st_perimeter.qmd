  - returns: double
    args: [geometry]

## Description

This function calculates the 2D perimeter of a given geometry. It supports Polygon, MultiPolygon, and GeometryCollection geometries (as long as the GeometryCollection contains polygonal geometries). For other types, it returns 0. To measure lines, use ST_Length.

## Examples

```sql
SELECT ST_Perimeter(ST_GeomFromWKT('POLYGON((0 0, 10 0, 10 10, 0 10, 0 0))'));
```

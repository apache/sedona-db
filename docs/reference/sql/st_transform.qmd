## Description

Transforms the coordinate reference system of a geometry between EPSG reference systems. If provided with 2 arguments, target_crs can be specified as an EPSG code (e.g., 'EPSG:4326') or as a PROJ string.

When a 3 arguments are provided, a source_crs can be used to specify the source CRS in case the input geometry doesn't have an SRID defined. The source_crs takes precedence over the geometry's SRID.

## Examples

```sql
SELECT ST_Transform(ST_SetCRS(ST_Point(-122.35, 47.65), 'EPSG:4326'), 'EPSG:26910');
```

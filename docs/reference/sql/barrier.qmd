## Description

`barrier()` evaluates a boolean expression string at runtime using bound column
values, and is marked as volatile to prevent the query optimizer from reordering
or pushing filters past it.

The first argument is a boolean expression string. After that, arguments come in
pairs of `(column_name, column_value)` that bind variables used in the
expression.

### Supported expression syntax

- **Comparison operators**: `=`, `==`, `!=`, `<>`, `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`
- **Logical operators**: `AND` / `and`, `OR` / `or`
- **Literal types**: integers, floats, single- or double-quoted strings, `true`, `false`, `null`
- Unrecognized expressions evaluate to `false`
- `NULL` comparisons evaluate to `false`

### When to use

Use `barrier()` when you need a predicate to be evaluated **after** a join or
scan rather than being pushed down by the optimizer. This is useful when the
predicate depends on values that are only available at a specific stage of
query execution.

## Examples

Filter rows using bound column values:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM orders
WHERE barrier('amount > 100 AND status = "active"',
              'amount', amount,
              'status', status);
```

Combine multiple conditions with different data types:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM products
WHERE barrier('price > 19.99 AND category = "electronics"',
              'price', price,
              'category', category);
```

Use `OR` logic:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM events
WHERE barrier('priority < 5 OR type = "critical"',
              'priority', priority,
              'type', type);
```

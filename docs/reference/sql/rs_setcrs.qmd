title: RS_SetCRS
description: Set the coordinate reference system (CRS) of the raster.

## Description

Sets the CRS (coordinate reference system) of the raster. This is metadata only — no pixel coordinate transformation occurs. Accepts authority:code identifiers such as `'EPSG:3857'` or `'OGC:CRS84'`. Use `'0'` to clear the CRS. `EPSG:4326` is normalized to `OGC:CRS84`.

## Examples

```sql
SELECT RS_SetCRS(RS_Example(), 'EPSG:3857');
```

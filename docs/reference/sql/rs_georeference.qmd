title: RS_GeoReference
description: >
  Returns the georeference metadata of raster as a string in GDAL or ESRI format
  as commonly seen in a world file. Default is GDAL if not specified. Both formats
  output six lines: scalex, skewy, skewx, scaley, upperleftx, upperlefty. In GDAL
  format the upper-left coordinates refer to the corner of the upper-left pixel,
  while in ESRI format they are shifted to the center of the upper-left pixel.

        to the center of the upper-left pixel.

SedonaDB is an open-source single-node analytical database engine with **geospatial as a first-class citizen**. It aims to deliver the fastest spatial analytics query speed and the most comprehensive function coverage available.

SedonaDB is perfect for processing smaller to medium datasets on local machines or cloud instances. For distributed workloads, you can leverage the power of SedonaSpark, SedonaFlink, or SedonaSnow.

## Architecture

![SedonaDB Architecture](image/sedonadb-architecture.svg)

* **Columnar in-memory datasets**
    * Spatial indexing
    * Spatial statistics
    * CRS tracking
    * Arrow format and zero serialization overhead

* **Spatial query optimization**
    * Spatial-aware heuristic based optimization
    * Spatial-aware cost based optimization

* **Spatial query processing**
    * Spatial range query, KNN query, spatial join query, KNN join query
    * Map algebra, NDVI, mask, zonal statistics

Raster functions are coming soon. We expect SedonaDB Raster will match all raster functions provided in [SedonaSpark](https://sedona.apache.org/latest/api/sql/Raster-operators/).

## Key features

SedonaDB has several advantages:

* **üöÄ High Performance:** Built in Rust for exceptional speed and memory efficiency
* **üó∫Ô∏è Comprehensive Spatial Toolkit:** Supports both vector and raster functions in a single library
* **üåç CRS Propagation:** Always maintains coordinate reference system information
* **üìÅ Format Flexibility:** Supports legacy and modern file formats including GeoParquet, Shapefile, GeoJSON
* **‚ö° Dual APIs:** Python and SQL interfaces for seamless workflow integration
* **üîß Extensible:** Easily customizable and extensible architecture
* **üîó Ecosystem Integration:** Interoperable with PyArrow-compatible libraries like GeoPandas, DuckDB, and Polars

## Install SedonaDB

Here's how to install SedonaDB with various build tools:

=== "pip"

	```bash
	pip install "apache-sedona[db]"
	```

=== "R"

	```bash
	install.packages("sedonadb", repos = "https://community.r-multiverse.org")
	```

## Run a query

SedonaDB offers a flexible query interface.

=== "Python"

    ```python
    import sedona.db

    sd = sedona.db.connect()
    sd.sql("SELECT ST_Point(0, 1) as geom")
	```

=== "R"

    ```r
    library(sedonadb)

    sd_sql("SELECT ST_Point(0, 1) as geom")
    ```

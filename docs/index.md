# SedonaDB

SedonaDB is a high-performance, dependency-free geospatial compute engine.

You can easily run SedonaDB locally or in the cloud.  The first release supports a core set of vector operations, but the full-suite of common vector and raster computations will be supported soon.

SedonaDB only runs on a single machine, so it’s perfect for processing smaller datasets.  You can use SedonaSpark, SedonaFlink, or SedonaSnow for operations on larger datasets.

=== "SQL"

	```sql
	SELECT ST_Point(0, 1) as geom
	```

=== "Python"

	```python
	import seonda.db

	sd = sedona.db.connect()
	sd.sql("SELECT ST_Point(0, 1) as geom")
	```

=== "Rust"

	```Rust
	use datafusion::prelude::*
	use sedona::context{SedonaContext, SedonaDataFrame};

	let ctx = SedonaContext::new_local_interactive().await?;
        let batches = ctx
            .sql("SELECT ST_Point(0, 1) as geom")
            .await?
            .show_sedona(&cts, None, Default::default())
            .await?;
	```

=== "R"

	```r
	library(sedonadb)

        sd_sql("SELECT ST_Point(0, 1) as geom")
	```

## Key features

* **Blazing fast**: SedonaDB runs on a single machine, optimized for geospatial workflows.
* SedonaDB is a **dependency-free**, **small binary** that is only XX KB.
* Supports **various file formats**, including GeoJSON, Shapefile, GeoParquet, CSV, and PostGIS.
* Exposes **several language APIs,** including SQL, Python, Rust, and R.
* **Portable**: Easy to run on the command line, locally or in the cloud with AWS Sagemaker, AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, Azure Machine Learning, or Google Colab.
* **Extensible**: You can extend SedonaDB to build your own geospatial compute engine custom for your needs.
* **Open source**: Apache Sedona is an open-source project managed according to the Apache Software Foundation's guidelines.

## Installation

Here’s how to install SedonaDB with various build tools:

=== "pip"

	```bash

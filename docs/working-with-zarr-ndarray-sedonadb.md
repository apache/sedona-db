# Working with Zarr and NDArray data in SedonaDB

SedonaDB's raster type is **N-dimensional**: a band isn't limited to a 2-D
`(y, x)` grid — it can carry additional axes such as `time` or `band`. This
makes it a natural fit for *datacubes*: climate reanalyses, satellite time
series, and model outputs.

The `sedonadb-zarr` extension reads [Zarr](https://zarr.dev/) groups —
local or in cloud object storage — directly into that raster type, so a
datacube becomes a table you can query in SQL.

This page walks through loading a Zarr datacube, inspecting its dimensions,
slicing out a 2-D plane, and handing the result to NumPy.

## Install

`sedonadb-zarr` is an extension, distributed separately from the core
SedonaDB package:

```bash
pip install "apache-sedona[db]" sedonadb-zarr zarr numpy geoarrow-pyarrow
```

`zarr` and `numpy` are used to build the sample datacube below;
`geoarrow-pyarrow` is required to export query results with
`to_arrow_table()`.

## Create a sample datacube

If you don't already have a Zarr group handy, this creates a small
`[time, y, x]` temperature cube to follow along with:

```python
import numpy as np
import zarr  # zarr-python >= 3.0

store = "/tmp/temperature.zarr"
root = zarr.open_group(store, mode="w")
arr = root.create_array(
    "temperature",
    shape=(3, 10, 20),
    chunks=(3, 5, 5),
    dtype="uint16",
    dimension_names=["time", "y", "x"],
)
arr[:] = np.arange(3 * 10 * 20, dtype="uint16").reshape(3, 10, 20)
```

The `chunks=(3, 5, 5)` argument leaves `time` un-chunked — every chunk
holds all three time steps — and tiles the `10 × 20` spatial grid into a
`2 × 4` grid of `5 × 5` patches. That's `8` chunks in total, and that
chunking is what determines how the data loads, as we'll see next.

## Connect and load

Register the extension on your connection, then read the Zarr group. With
the extension registered, a path ending in `.zarr` is recognized
automatically — no `format` argument needed:

```python
import sedona.db
import sedonadb_zarr

sd = sedona.db.connect()
sd.register(sedonadb_zarr.ZarrExtension())

df = sd.read(f"file://{store}")
df.to_view("cube")
```

If your group's path doesn't end in `.zarr` (common for object-store
layouts), name the format explicitly:
`sd.read(uri, format=sedonadb_zarr.Zarr())`.

`sedonadb-zarr` emits **one row per Zarr chunk**, with one band per array
in the group. Our cube tiles into eight chunks, so it loads as eight rows
— each a `[3, 5, 5]` tile holding all three time steps for one `5 × 5`
spatial patch:

```python
sd.sql("SELECT COUNT(*) AS n_chunks FROM cube").show()
```

```text
┌──────────┐
│ n_chunks │
│   int64  │
╞══════════╡
│        8 │
└──────────┘
```

## Inspect the dimensions

The dimension-query functions read the raster's schema only — **no pixel
data is loaded** — so they return near-instantly even against a large
remote cube. Each row reports its **chunk's** shape, not the full cube
extent. All eight chunks share the same shape here, so we look at one:

```python
sd.sql("""
    SELECT
        RS_NumDimensions(raster)   AS ndim,
        RS_DimNames(raster)        AS dims,
        RS_Shape(raster)           AS shape,
        RS_DimSize(raster, 'time') AS n_time
    FROM cube
    LIMIT 1
""").show()
```

```text
┌───────┬──────────────┬───────────┬────────┐
│  ndim ┆     dims     ┆   shape   ┆ n_time │
│ int32 ┆     list     ┆    list   ┆  int64 │
╞═══════╪══════════════╪═══════════╪════════╡
│     3 ┆ [time, y, x] ┆ [3, 5, 5] ┆      3 │
└───────┴──────────────┴───────────┴────────┘
```

Each chunk is 3-dimensional (`[time, y, x]`) with all three time steps
(`n_time = 3`) and a `5 × 5` spatial footprint — one tile of the full
`10 × 20` grid.

## Slice out a 2-D plane

`RS_Slice` selects a single index along a named dimension and drops it.
Picking time step `1` turns every `[3, 5, 5]` chunk into a `[y, x]` plane
— the `5 × 5` patch at that time step, one per row:

```python
sliced = sd.sql("SELECT RS_Slice(raster, 'time', 1) AS plane FROM cube")
sliced.to_view("plane")

sd.sql("SELECT RS_DimNames(plane) AS dims, RS_Shape(plane) AS shape FROM plane LIMIT 1").show()
```

```text
┌────────┬────────┐
│  dims  ┆  shape │
│  list  ┆  list  │
╞════════╪════════╡
│ [y, x] ┆ [5, 5] │
└────────┴────────┘
```

`RS_Slice` needs pixel data, so SedonaDB resolves each row's Zarr chunk on
demand before slicing — you never call a loader yourself. Because `time`
isn't chunked, the slice index is the global time step: `0`, `1`, or `2`
all select a real plane.

Related functions reshape a cube in other ways:

- `RS_SliceRange(raster, dim, start, end)` keeps a contiguous range of a
  dimension instead of a single index.
- `RS_DimToBand(raster, dim)` / `RS_BandToDim(raster, dim_name)` move an
  axis between the dimension list and the band list.

## Bring a slice into NumPy

A raster band carries its bytes, shape, and pixel type, so a materialized
band decodes to a correctly-shaped, correctly-typed NumPy array in one call —
`Band.to_numpy()`:

```python
planes = sliced.to_arrow_table()["plane"]
raster = planes[0].as_py()  # each row is one 5x5 spatial tile at time step 1
print(raster.bands[0].to_numpy())
```

```text
[[200 201 202 203 204]
 [220 221 222 223 224]
 [240 241 242 243 244]
 [260 261 262 263 264]
 [280 281 282 283 284]]
```

Each of the eight rows decodes to a `5 × 5` spatial tile at time step `1`;
this is one of them. Rows correspond to chunks rather than a guaranteed
order, so apply your own `ORDER BY` (or carry a chunk identifier) if you
need to know which spatial tile a given plane covers.

## Reading from cloud storage

The same code reads a datacube over S3 or HTTP(S) — only the URI changes:

```python
df = sd.read("s3://my-bucket/temperature.zarr")
```

Supported URI schemes are `file://` (and bare local paths), `s3://`,
`http://`, and `https://`. S3 credentials are read from the standard AWS
environment variables (for example `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_REGION`).

### Selecting arrays with the `arrays` option

By default SedonaDB discovers a group's arrays automatically — from the
group's consolidated metadata when present, otherwise by listing the
store. The `arrays` option names an explicit subset to read instead:

```python
spec = sedonadb_zarr.Zarr().with_options({"arrays": ["temperature"]})
df = sd.read("s3://my-bucket/temperature.zarr", format=spec)
```

Naming arrays is needed in two situations:

- **The store can't list and has no consolidated metadata.** Plain HTTP
  servers generally can't list directories. Cloud Zarr v3 groups usually
  ship a consolidated-metadata block, so `http(s)://` reads typically work
  without `arrays` — but a group lacking one can't be auto-discovered over
  such a store, and you must name the arrays.
- **The group mixes arrays with different shapes or chunk grids.** Every
  array read together must share one chunk grid, so name a compatible
  subset (for example, read the data variables and leave out a
  differently-shaped coordinate or summary array).

Because each row corresponds to one chunk, a `LIMIT` or row filter
directly bounds how many chunks SedonaDB fetches — handy for sampling a
large remote cube before committing to a full scan.

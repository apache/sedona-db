## Description

`ST_KNN` is used in a join condition to find the k nearest neighbors of one geometry from another set of geometries. The actual k-nearest neighbors logic is handled by the spatial join execution engine: the function itself is a stub that simply defines the expected signature.

## Examples

```sql
WITH table2 AS (
    SELECT geom1 FROM (VALUES
        (ST_Point(0, 1)),
        (ST_Point(2, 3)),
        (ST_Point(4, 5)),
        (ST_Point(6, 7)),
        (ST_Point(8, 9))
    ) AS t(geom1)
),
table1 AS (
    SELECT ST_Point(0, 0) AS geom2
)
SELECT * FROM table1 JOIN table2 ON ST_KNN(geom1, geom2, 3);
```

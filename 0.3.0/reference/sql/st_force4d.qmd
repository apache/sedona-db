## Description

If the geometry already has Z and M values they are preserved; otherwise optional `z` and `m` arguments (both default 0) are used.

## Examples

```sql
SELECT ST_Force4D(ST_GeomFromWKT('POINT (1 2)'), 10.0, 20.0);
```

```sql
SELECT ST_Force4D(ST_GeomFromWKT('POINT (1 2)'), 10.0);
```

```sql
SELECT ST_Force4D(ST_GeomFromWKT('POINT (1 2)'));
```

```sql
SELECT ST_Force4D(ST_GeomFromWKT('POINT ZM (1 2 3 4)'), 10.0, 20.0);
```

title: ST_Zmflag
description: Returns a code indicating the dimension of the coordinates in a geometry.

  - returns: integer
    args: [geometry]

## Description

Returns a code indicating the coordinate dimension:

- 0 = 2D (XY)
- 1 = 3D with M coordinate (XYM)
- 2 = 3D with Z coordinate (XYZ)
- 3 = 4D (XYZM)

## Examples

2D (XY) returns 0:

```sql
SELECT ST_Zmflag(ST_GeomFromWKT('LINESTRING(1 2, 3 4)'));
```

3D with M coordinate (XYM) returns 1:

```sql
SELECT ST_Zmflag(ST_GeomFromWKT('LINESTRING M(1 2 3, 3 4 3)'));
```

3D with Z coordinate (XYZ) returns 2:

```sql
SELECT ST_Zmflag(ST_GeomFromWKT('LINESTRING Z(1 2 3, 3 4 5)'));
```

4D (XYZM) returns 3:

```sql
SELECT ST_Zmflag(ST_GeomFromWKT('LINESTRING ZM(1 2 3 4, 3 4 5 6)'));
```

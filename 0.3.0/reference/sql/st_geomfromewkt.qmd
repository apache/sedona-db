title: ST_GeomFromEWKT
description: Constructs a geometry from Extended Well-Known Text (EWKT).
kernels:
  - returns: geometry
    args:
    - name: ewkt
      type: string
---

## Description

Parses an EWKT string in the format `SRID=<srid>;<wkt>` and returns a geometry with the embedded SRID set. EWKT is used by PostGIS and other systems for human-readable output when an item-level SRID required.

## Examples

```sql
SELECT ST_GeomFromEWKT('SRID=4326;POINT(40.7128 -74.0060)');
```

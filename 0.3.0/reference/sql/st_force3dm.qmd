title: ST_Force3DM
description: Forces a geometry into a XYM coordinate model with an optional M value.
kernels:
  - returns: geometry
    args: [geometry]
  - returns: geometry
    args:
    - geometry
    - name: m
      type: double
---

## Description

If the geometry already has M values they are preserved; otherwise the optional `m` argument (default 0) is used.

## Examples

```sql
SELECT ST_Force3DM(ST_GeomFromWKT('POINT (1 2)'), 10.0);
```

```sql
SELECT ST_Force3DM(ST_GeomFromWKT('POINT (1 2)'));
```

```sql
SELECT ST_Force3DM(ST_GeomFromWKT('POINT M (1 2 3)'), 10.0);
```

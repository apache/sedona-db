title: ST_IsValid
description: Checks whether a geometry meets the rules of a valid spatial object according to the OGC standard.
kernels:
  - returns: boolean
    args: [geometry]

## Description

Returns `true` if the geometry is well-formed according to OGC rules. Use
`ST_IsValidReason` to get a diagnostic message for invalid geometries and
`ST_MakeValid` to attempt to repair them.

## Examples

```sql
SELECT ST_IsValid(
    ST_GeomFromText('POLYGON ((0 0, 2 0, 2 2, 1 1, 0 2, 0 0))')
) AS is_valid;
```
